HOW TO RUN:-

Step 1 : Open the folder Database and it contains a SQL file of tables(with dummy data) .

Step 2: Run the code ( master.java) on any IDE.

INTRODUCTION:-

This project starts with giving customers the choice to sign up (using a new email id) if he/she is a new user or login using email and password. Customer also enters his/her address (city and area also) The system checks for the correctness of these credentials. After this he is given several options.

If we choses he wants to order some food then he is shown restaurants(along with menus) of his city only . He can choose to order from any restaurant and enter the name of the food item and quantity required. He is given a choice to enter items directly in the cart ( from here he will be directed to the order page directly) or save items in the wishlist for future use .

On the order page: He is given a choice if he still wants to do any modification in his cart items , Total amount is calculated for the items using the menu table and delivery charges are calculated according to the distance between the area of customer and the restaurant chosen . After his final amount is calculated he is given promo codes: To save 50% , if already used this then he is given another promo code to save 20%. After this he is directed to the payment gateway where he is given several payment modes , he can choose any of them and place his order .

He can then rate the restaurant and the app also . After this he is given a real time tracking feature for his order . He is even provided the choice to cancel the order if the time has exceeded 10% more than the total expected delivery time .

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:-

HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:-

RAM : At least 128 MB
Disk Space : 124 MB for JRE, 2 MB for Java Update

DATABASE:-

Schema of the different table which we used:-

Customer Table

Restaurant Table

Menu Table

Area Coordinates Table

Cart Table

Wishlist Table

Order Table

Rating Table

OVERVIEW OF ALL CLASSES :-

INHERITANCE OF CLASSES :-

Class OnlineFoodOrderingSystem is superclass for :-

SignUp
Login
Order
PaymentMode
Tracking
Rating
Class Order is superclass for:-

Restaurant
Cart
Wishlist
Class Restaurant is superclass for:-

Menu
ENCAPSULATION :-

Order class have various variables like final_amount, delivery_amount and order_amount .

It have 4 major functions :-

calc_final_amount() :-
sums up the value of order_amount and delivery_amount.

calc_order_amount() :-
Calculate the total value of items in the cart by using the menu table to get prices and then multiply by quantity and return order_amount.

calc_delivery_amount() :-
	Calculate the delivery_amount using the area coordinates of

	user and the area coordinates of restaurant.

check_promo_code():-
The user profile is checked if he is left with his promo codes (using customer_id to refer customer table) and then he can have choice to use any one offer among promo_code_50 or promo_code_20 ( this saves 50% and 20% respectively) . So final_amount can be modified in this function.

Here we see we have many different tasks to be done on these four variables and instead of doing them in different classes and making all the variables global , we made class Order which have different functions to perform all the required tasks on these variables .

ABSTRACTION :-

An interface is a completely abstract class for grouping related methods with empty bodies.

As we are using interface's methods , we only know the classes that implement it and their methods and therefore all knowledge about the implementation is concealed from the user, resulting in 100 percent abstraction.

We have used the ‘Connection’ interface to establish database connection in our program. Which helps to perform data abstraction in our program.

DATABASE CONNECTIVITY :-

We performed database connectivity using a public function namely sqlconnect() whose return type is ‘Connection’. It is a public function which uses try catch exception handling to perform database connection. We established a connection using ‘Connection’ class object as follows:-

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url,UserName,Password);

Where;

con: It is a reference to the ‘Connection’ interface.

url : Uniform Resource Locator which is created as shown below:

String url = “jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/oopd”;

​​UserName: username from which our SQL command prompt can be accessed.

Password: password from which our SQL command prompt can be accessed.
